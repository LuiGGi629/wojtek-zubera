Hi! I'm Wojtek, welcome to my page about hardest part of the job. I'm a former professional e-gamer, currently machine learning engineer.

When asked about the hardest part of the job, I reply itâ€™s not machine learning, considering most our ML looks like:

```python
from sklearn import Model

Model.fit(features, target)
predictions = model.predict(testing_features)
```

Instead, the hardest parts of data science are developing everything that occurs before and after modeling. Before we have: loading data from a database, feature engineering, data validation, and data processing pipelines (assuming our job starts after data is ingested). After we need to verify the results, set tasks to run automatically on a schedule, write results back to our database and send off webhooks to trigger other services.

I started this blog for two purposes: to write about what I'm learning, and to share my perspectives and reflections with others and my future self. The former reason function mainly to reinforce what I'm learning. Most of the blog posts are a living document(jupyter notebook), so I'll come back and edit things. These are also informal posts, more of a quick brain dump than a work of art. To be honest, this is more of a journal than a blog, but I've chosen to make this public in the case of:

a) the content can help someone else

b) someone disagrees and we can have a discussion.

I appreciate feedback and constructive criticism. The best place to reach me is in the comments, or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wojtek-zubera-18895415b/)
